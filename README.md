# About me 👋


**S9Den8/S9Den8** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on actually learning Excel (i.e., VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, pivot tables, & basic dashboards)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about GitHub and Git
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with developing a solid foundation in data analytics 
- 💬 Ask me about my vision of the future
- 😶‍🌫️ Interests: I love making art
- 🪬 Skills: I have been told I am skilled in a variety of subjects. However, I don't believe it. Mastery can only be achieved when it becomes a lifelong pursuit.
- 🎨 Hobbies: Connecting dots between seemingly unrelated topics
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to read about ciphertexts and was quite interested in the Cicaida 3301  mystery.
