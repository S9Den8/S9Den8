## Focus

Aspiring data analyst focused on artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am learning how to observe systems carefully, question assumptions, and understand structure before interpretation. I value privacy, independent verification, and systems that encourage critical thinking rather than passive consumption. I believe technology should be built to preserve human autonomy and support the collective good.

## What I’m Learning

Beginner level Python with emphasis on logic, control flow, and reading errors. I work with Pandas to explore and clean data, use Seaborn to visualize relationships, and practice SQL basics. I track progress with Git and GitHub.

## Projects (In Progress)

### Python Practice and Logic Exercises
Small programs focused on control flow, functions, and debugging, with emphasis on understanding errors and program behavior rather than optimization.

### Data Exploration with Pandas
Practice notebooks using real datasets to clean data, inspect structure, and ask basic analytical questions.

### Data Visualization Experiments
Exploratory visualizations using Seaborn to understand relationships and distributions, focused on clarity and interpretation.

### Cryptography and Pattern Study
Ongoing study of historical ciphers and undeciphered texts as a way to understand structure, encoding, verification, and pattern emergence.

## How I Got Here

I started with language, symbols, and puzzles. Cryptography and undeciphered texts taught me patience, skepticism, and the value of verification. I learned to stay with problems rather than rush to conclusions.

That approach carried naturally into data analysis. Data behaves like another language. I move slowly and deliberately, valuing accuracy over speed and clarity over performance. I am interested in using data to support nonprofit and public interest work where careful analysis matters.

## Where I’m Headed

I plan to study machine learning from first principles, understand model behavior rather than treating systems as black boxes, and eventually build a language model of my own. I am also developing an interest in Linux, decentralized systems, and mesh networks, with a focus on resilient and privacy respecting infrastructure.
