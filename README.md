**Focus**

Aspiring data analyst with an interest in artificial intelligence. I am learning how to observe systems carefully, work with data responsibly, and understand structure before interpretation.

---

**What I’m Learning**

Beginner level Python with emphasis on logic, control flow, and reading errors. I work with Pandas to explore and clean data, use Seaborn to visualize relationships, and practice SQL basics. I track progress with Git and GitHub.

**How I Got Here**

I started with language, symbols, and puzzles. Cryptography and undeciphered texts like the Voynich Manuscript taught me patience and pattern awareness. Data analysis felt familiar because data behaves like another language.

---

**Where I’m Headed**

I plan to study machine learning from first principles, build a language model in the future, and deepen my understanding of Linux, decentralized systems, and mesh networks.

**How I Work**

I move slowly and deliberately. I value accuracy over speed and clarity over performance. I am interested in using data to support nonprofit and public interest work where careful analysis matters.
